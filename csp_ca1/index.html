Co-lead singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Robertson">Ed Robertson</a> was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh">Simon Singh's</a> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(book)">Big Bang</a>,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory#cite_note-25">[25]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> and at the concert he improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]
