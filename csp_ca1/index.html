We worked hard to get all the science right."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory#cite_note-deseretnews2-5">[5]</a></sup> David Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.<sup>[23]</sup> He saw early versions of scripts that needed scientific information added to them, and he also pointed out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, had made a mistake. He was usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, was involved.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory#cite_note-wired-24">[24]</a></sup>

            <h2>Theme song</h2>

            <p>
                id="3"The Canadian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="https://en.     wikipedia.org/wiki/Barenaked_Ladies">Barenaked Ladies</a> wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Robertson">Ed Robertson</a> was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh">Simon Singh's</a> book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(book)">Big Bang</a>,<sup>[25][26]</sup> and at the concert he improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]
            </p>

            <p>
                On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.<sup>[27]</sup> Although some unofficial pages identify the song title as "History of Everything,"<sup>[28]</sup> the cover art for the single identifies the title as "Big Bang Theory Theme." A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.<sup>[29][30]</sup> The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hits_from_Yesterday_%26_the_Day_Before">Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before</a>, released on September 27, 2011.<sup>[31]</sup> In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued[needs update] former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20 percent of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money for himself.<sup>[32]</sup>
